During that time, they created several memories together and welcomed kids that they loved with all their hearts. Today, even as ex-lovers, both Bernard and Foster remain friends. It is noteworthy that even though she is most well-known as Jodie Foster’s ex-lover, Cydney Bernard has also built a career of her own as a movie production manager.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Cydney Bernard’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Cydney Bernard</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 30 March 1953</li><li><strong>Cydney Bernard’s Age:</strong> 70 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> White</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Aries</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Lesbian</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Unmarried</li><li><strong>Cydney Bernard’s Children:</strong> Kit Bernard Foster and Charles Bernard Foster</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Dustin Bernard</li><li><strong>Cydney Bernard’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 1 inch</li><li><strong>Cydney Bernard’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 157 cm</li><li><strong>Cydney Bernard’s Weight:</strong> 58 kg</li><li><strong>Cydney Bernard’s Net worth:</strong> $500,000</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being Jodie Foster’s ex-lover</li></ul><h2><strong>What is Cydney Bernard’s Age Now?</strong></h2><p>Cydney Bernard is currently 70 years old. The movie production manager was born on the 30th day of March 1953 in the United States. The exact city or town of her birth is not known at the moment. This is mainly because, unlike her famous ex-lover, Jodie Foster, not much is known about Bernard’s background.</p><p>Because there is very little information about her background, details about Cydney Bernard’s parents also remain unknown. It is also not clear how she grew up or if she had any early experiences that shaped her life as an adult. It is clear that Cydney Bernard went to school and had some form of formal education. However, it is not certain what schools she attended.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Cydney1.jpg><h3><strong>She Has a Brother Named Dustin Bernard</strong></h3><p>Despite the lack of information about her background, we were able to find out that Cydney Bernard actually has a brother, and he is called Dustin Bernard. Interestingly, Dustin Bernard is also a production manager and movie producer.</p><p>We know that they are siblings; however, details about Cydney and Dustin’s childhood days and how they grew up together remain unknown.</p><h2><strong>Cydney Bernard and Jodie Foster Met on the Set of a Movie</strong></h2><p>Cydney Bernard and Jodie Foster’s love story began on the set of a movie. According to our findings, the lovebirds met while they were working on the set of the 1993 movie called Sommersby. Bernard was working as a production coordinator on the movie while Foster was starring in it, playing the role of Laurel Sommersby.</p><p>While they were working on the movie together, Bernard and Foster took note of each other and realized they shared the same affection for themselves. They connected immediately and decided to meet up after the movie production was over. This was exactly what they did. They started dating almost immediately.</p><h3><strong>Bernard and Foster’s Love Story as Live-In Partners</strong></h3><p>For many years, Cydney Bernard and Jodie Foster dated silently without letting the outside world know of what was going on between them. They were seen together most of the time but many people thought they were just best friends who were having an awesome time with each other. Little did they know!</p><p>Our findings show that shortly after they started dating, Bernard and Foster moved in together in West Hollywood and became live-in partners who did everything together. For several years, the two women wore matching Tiffany eternity rings on their wedding fingers and were practically inseparable.</p><p>Both women were said to enjoy yoga a lot and went to yoga classes together. They also practiced together. It was also reported that Jodie Foster also loved kickboxing and karate but Bernard didn’t join her to do this. The couple very often went for walks together and were seen in each other’s company a number of times by fans. They also went on romantic vacations and getaways.</p><p>The couple had so many things in common. They shared the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">same views about parenting</a> and were on the same page when it came to the methods of raising their children. They also shared the same views about cooking. According to reports, they both loved preparing meals from scratch using organic food and so they rarely had disagreements when it came to making foods and raising their kids.</p><p>Every now and then, Jodie Foster would land a movie role and Bernard would be called to manage a movie production project. However, most of the time, the lovers mainly stayed at home making love and taking their kids for picnics. They were also known to go for big family holidays to Europe or the Caribbean sometimes with family members coming along too.</p><p>According to some insiders, during occasions like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the couple usually went the extra mile to cement their relationship by spending a lot of time together and even inviting family members too. In fact, Foster’s mother, an American movie producer called Evelyn Ella “Brandy” was a usual guest in their home during these celebrations.</p><p>The ex-lovers were also said to be avid collectors of fancy kitchen goods. They also loved buying arty black-and-white photographs. The fact that they loved doing so many things together kept their love burning for each other for a long time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Cydney-B1.jpg><h3><strong>The World Confirmed Their Romance 14 Years Later</strong></h3><p>Interestingly, even though Cydney Bernard and Jodie Foster were head over heels in love and doing virtually everything together, much of the outside world didn’t know about their relationship. This was because they never talked about it and made sure they kept things under wraps from the prying eyes of the media. They both loved their privacy so it was easy for them to keep their romance hidden.</p><p>However, even though they tried to keep things hidden for a long time, the media and fans soon began to suspect that there was something more than just mere friendship going on between Bernard and Foster. Rumors soon began to fly around that the movie producer was dating the actress but this was not confirmed for a while, making fans very curious about what Jodie Foster’s sexuality really was.</p><p>Finally, Jodie Foster came open about the whole relationship and stunned people with her admittance in 2017, about 14 years after they started their romance. In December that year, Foster attended the annual Women in Entertainment Breakfast event to accept an award. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Foster was honored at that event</a> so she attended it with Bernard and other family members, including her mother.</p><p>While accepting the award, she gave a vote of thanks and in the process thanked Cydney, saying “…my beautiful Cydney, who sticks with me through all the rotten and the bliss.” Jodie Foster’s comments about Cydney Bernard quickly confirmed to people that the actress was in a relationship with Bernard. However, some dismissed it as just an appreciative comment directed at a friend. But there was some frenzy in the media about Foster’s comments.</p><h3><strong>The Couple Welcomed Two Boys</strong></h3><p>While they were together, Cydney Bernard and Jodie Foster welcomed two kids together. According to reports, both kids were born by Foster. The actress conceived the babies with the help of a sperm donor. Foster has never revealed the identity of the boys’ biological father, but some people say the biological father of the kids is her friend Randy Stone, a gay film director. This information has not been independently confirmed.</p><p>As expected, Cydney Bernard was with Jodie Foster throughout both her labors and helped to take care of the actress when the kids were born. After the children were born, they shared the names of both Bernard and Foster. Both kids had the middle name Bernard and the family name Foster; the first child was called Charles Bernard Foster, and the second was called Kit Bernard Foster.</p><h2><strong>Meet Cydney Bernard’s Children</strong></h2><p>Cydney Bernard’s children are Charles Bernard Foster and Kit Bernard Foster. They are the children that she and Foster welcomed during their time together and greater details are provided about the boys below.</p><h3><strong>Charles Bernard Foster</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Kit-Bernard.jpg><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Charles Bernard Foster</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 20 July 1998</li><li><strong>Charles Bernard Foster’s Age:</strong> 25 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> White</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Cancer</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Unmarried</li><li><strong>Charles Bernard Foster’s Parents:</strong> Jodie Foster and Cydney Bernard</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Kit Bernard Foster</li><li><strong>Charles Bernard Foster’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 8 inches</li><li><strong>Charles Bernard Foster’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 172 cm</li><li><strong>Charles Bernard Foster’s Weight:</strong> 62 kg</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being Jodie Foster’s son</li></ul><p>Charles Bernard Foster is the first child of Jodie Foster and Cydney Bernard. He was born on 20 July 1998, about five years after his parents started dating in 1993. He is now 25 years old. Both Cydney and Foster were overly protective of the boy after he was born and barely</p><p>Not much is known about Charles, as he has remained largely out of public sight. However, his mother has some insight into what his career life could turn out to be. In 2016, she explained that Charles is taking a serious liking to acting and is into Improv. She also revealed that he will <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">certainly do well in Hollywood.</a></p><h3><strong>Kit Bernard Foster</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Kit-Bernard1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Kit Bernard Foster</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 29 September 2001</li><li><strong>Kit Bernard Foster’s Age:</strong> 22 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> White</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Libra</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Unmarried</li><li><strong>Kit Bernard Foster’s Parents:</strong> Jodie Foster and Cydney Bernard</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Charles Bernard Foster</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being Jodie Foster’s son</li></ul><p>Kit Bernard Foster is the son of Jodie Foster and Cydney Bernard. The boy was born on 29 September 2001 and is now 22 years old. Just like his brother, Charles, nothing much is known about Kit as he was largely protected from the public glare while growing up.</p><p>However, his mother, Foster, has also given some insight into what he might become in the future. In 2016, the popular actress explained that Kit is the nicest man ever and that he is likely to become a musician. She also reveals that he likes to play the trombone, a musical instrument.</p><p>The fact that Cydney Bernard and Jodie Foster made sure that their kids shared their names was a statement about the permanence of the arrangement. It was clear that the lovers were planning to remain together forever and perhaps get married in the long run.</p><p>While their sons were kids, Bernard and Foster were known to love driving them to school in one of the couple’s matching convertible BMWs. They raised the boys in the suburban comfort of West Hollywood and often went for walks in the local park with their dogs. They had lived as a “regular” family, and everything seemed to be under control.</p><h2><strong>How Long Were Jodie Foster and Cydney Bernard Together?</strong></h2><p>Cydney Bernard and Jodie Foster were together for 15 years before they separated. Their separation stunned many people because everyone thought they were going to be together forever. In fact, at some point, rumors began to spread that when the time was right, the couple might even formalize their romance with a&nbsp; wedding. They were the perfect couple who adored each other.</p><p>However, things took a sad and unforeseen turn in 2008 when the couple decided to part ways. At this time, they had been together for about 15 years. For some time, no one knew they had broken up. There were rumors about them parting ways, but no one was sure because neither Bernard nor Foster talked about the development.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/bernard1.jpg><h3><strong>Why They Parted Ways</strong></h3><p>Eventually, sources who knew the couple began to speak about the matter. According to some sources, it was Jodie Foster who broke the relationship. The actress reportedly broke up with Bernard to pursue a relationship with another producer/writer called Cindy Mort. Incidentally, Foster and Cindy Mort met the same way that she and Cydney Bernard met on the set of a movie.</p><p>According to reports, Foster and Mort met on the set of The Brave One, a psychological thriller film in 2006. They got together and began dating. The affair got in the way of Foster and Bernard’s romance so they had to part ways in 2008.</p><h3><strong>Foster’s Second Acknowledgment of Bernard Made Her More Popular</strong></h3><p>As we mentioned before, Jodie Foster first talked about Cydney Bernard in 2007 when she attended the annual Women in Entertainment Breakfast event to accept an award and publicly insinuated that they were dating. At the time, the news made headlines but not everyone took too much of it because Fister was not too straightforward with her ‘coming out’ message to say she was gay.</p><p>However, Foster later made mention of Bernard for the second time publicly in 2013 and this time it caused quite a huge stir. In January 2013, about 4 years after she had separated from Cydney Bernard, Jodie Foster won the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 70th Golden Globe Awards and attended the event to receive it.</p><p>While she was giving her acceptance speech for the Cecile B. DeMille award, Jodie Foster paid tribute to Cydney Bernard and finally revealed, in strong terms, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">that she was gay</a>. This stunned people because even though some people knew she was previously with Bernard, Foster was not known to be very vocal about her private life, and so the fact she admitted her sexuality after years of rumors caught the attention of the media.</p><p>During her speech, she referred to Bernard as her “heroic co-parent, her ex-partner in love, but righteous soul sister in life, her confessor and her most beloved BFF of 20 years”. So, the interesting thing was that, while Foster confirmed that she was gay, she also used the opportunity to confirm that she had parted ways with Bernard and was single.</p><p>After the Golden Globe Awards, serious media attention turned to Cydney Bernard, who had always loved to be away from the spotlight. People wanted to know all about how Bernard and Foster came to become lovers and what caused them to break up after spending 15 years together. All this rush for information about Bernard exploded her popularity beyond words.</p><h3><strong>Who is Cydney Bernard’s Ex-girlfriend, Jodie Foster?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Foster.jpg><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Alicia Christian “Jodie” Foster</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> November 19, 1962</li><li><strong>Jodie Foster’s Age:</strong> 61 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> English, German and Irish heritage</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Scorpio</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Gay</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Jodie Foster’s Wife:</strong> Alexandra Hedison</li><li><strong>Jodie Foster’s Children:</strong> Kit Bernard Foster and Charles Bernard Foster</li><li><strong>Jodie Foster’s Parents:</strong> Parents: Evelyn Ella Almond and Lucius Fisher Foster III</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Lucinda Foster, Constance Foster, Lucius ‘Buddy’ Foster</li><li><strong>Jodie Foster’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 3 inches</li><li><strong>Jodie Foster’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 160 cm</li><li><strong>Jodie Foster’s Weight:</strong> 58 kg</li><li><strong>Body measurements in inches:</strong> 33-24-33 inches</li><li><strong>Body measurements in centimeters:</strong> 83-61-83 cm</li><li><strong>Jodie Foster’s Net Worth:</strong> $ 100 million</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being a Hollywood actress, director, and producer.</li></ul><p>Jodie Foster is a highly respected American actress, director, and producer. Born on November 19, 1962, Foster began her career very early. In fact, she was just three years old when her career began with an appearance in a Coppertone television advertisement in 1965. She kept on working in advertising and starred in over 50 television shows as a child. Eventually, made her acting debut in 1968 starring in the television sitcom Mayberry R.F.D.</p><p>Foster starred in many several television series in the late 1960s and early 1970s before making her film debut in Disney’s Napoleon and Samantha in 1972. Eventually, she got her breakthrough in 1976 after she starred in the psychological thriller film called Taxi Driver, playing the role of a child prostitute. She got a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Foster soon became a popular teen idol by appearing in movies like Disney’s Freaky Friday in 1976, Candleshoe in 1977), and Carny in 1980.</p><p>In 1988, she emerged the winner of the Academy Award for Best Actress after playing the role of a rape survivor in the legal drama The Accused. Three years later in 1991, she won her second Academy Award for playing the role of FBI agent Clarice Starling in the psychological horror film The Silence of the Lambs. Over the years, she has become one of the most successful actresses of her time, winning several awards including two Academy Awards, three British Academy Film Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award.</p><p>Despite being si popular, Jodie Fister was notoriously private about her private life and even she got together with Cydney Bernard, she kept their romance very private. However, because of her huge popularity, it was only a matter of time before the cat was let out of the bag and once people got to know the identity of Bernard, the movie production manager was shot into the limelight.</p><h3><strong>The Ex-Lovers Are Still Cordial</strong></h3><p>Jodie Foster and Cydney Bernard are no longer together as lovers. However, this has not stopped them from remaining cordial and friendly. According to our findings, the two ex-lovers remain in close contact, as they share joint custody of their two sons. The ex-lovers have been spotted together a few times, even after their breakup.</p><p>For instance, in May 2013, Foster and Bernard were spotted together after they met up for a casual coffee date at Starbucks in Los Angeles’ posh Bel-Air neighborhood. The former lovers were seen <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">giving each other a warm and long embrace</a> during the meeting. This confirmed that they were still very cordial despite their breakup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Cydney-Bernard.jpg><p>Again, in November 2013, the two ex-lovers were spotted together once more. This time, Jodie Foster was seen helping Cydney Bernard to move furniture in Santa Monica. Both of them were very relaxed in each other’s company as they worked. Apparently, the former live-in partners are still very much enjoying an amicable friendship at the moment.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Cydney Bernard Dating at the Moment?</strong></h3><p>Cydney Bernard is possibly single at the moment. The production manager has always been a very quiet and private person who minds her business. Since she broke up with Foster, very little has been reported about her, and she has not been seen or linked with anyone romantically. So, it is widely believed that she is currently single.</p><p>On the other hand, Jodie Foster has had other partners since moving on from Bernard. After breaking up with Bernard, she started dating Cindy Mort, a director, screenwriter, and producer. However, the two did not last too long because Cindy Mort <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">reportedly dumped Foster</a> in 2009, leaving the actress devastated.</p><p>Foster later fell in love with Alexandra Hedison, an American photographer, director, and actress. The couple dated for about a year before <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">tying the knot in April 2014.</a> So, Jodie Foster is now a married woman.</p><h2><strong>Cydney Bernard Worked as a Production Manager</strong></h2><p>Today, everyone knows Cydney Bernard as Jodie Foster’s ex-lover. Whenever her name is called, it is associated with Foster. However, falling in love with Foster is not the only thing that Bernard has been able to do with her life. As a matter of fact, she had already built a career in Hollywood as a production manager before she met Jodie Foster.</p><p>According to our findings, Cydney Bernard has been active in Hollywood and has been working in production since the late 80s. In fact, in 1989, she worked as a production coordinator on Cold Feet, a comedy/Indie film. She also worked as a production coordinator on the 1990 comedy/fantasy film A Mom for Christmas, the 1991 Comedy/Romance film, L.A. Story, and the 1993 drama/romance movie Sommersby.</p><p>Bernard quickly rose from the position of production coordinator to production supervisor then to production manager, and eventually to producer. In 1993, she worked as the assistant production manager on the movie Family Prayers. She then served as the production supervisor on the 1994 thriller/drama film The Client. The same year, she worked yet again as the production supervisor on the sci-fi film Roswell.</p><p>In 1996, she became a production manager and worked in that capacity on the fantasy/adventure movie, Loch Ness. The same year, she served as the unit production manager on the western/drama movie, Ruby Jean and Joe before working as a unit production manager on the popular comedy/slapstick movie, Bean.</p><p>Bernard eventually became a producer.
