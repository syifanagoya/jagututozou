It was a home birth that occurred at her parents’ Beverly Hills home in California. She is undoubtedly an American citizen of white ethnicity.</p><p>Banks is the daughter of American music superstar and former teenage pop singer Hilary Duff. Hillary, who already had a son, said giving birth to a baby girl was a great deal to her as the multi-talented artist started buying everything pink even before she conceived.</p><p>Bank’s dad, on the other hand, is Hilary’s boyfriend-turned-husband, Matthew Koma. Matt, whose given name is Matthew Bair, is a Grammy Award-winning musician, songwriter, and music producer; he is the leader of the popular Winnetka Bowling League band. Matt was overjoyed at the news of becoming a first-time dad and dyed his hair pink in anticipation of Bank’s birth.</p><h3><strong>Hilary Debuted Her Daughter on Instagram From Day One</strong></h3><p>Right from the moment she was confirmed to be expecting, Banks Violet Bair’s mum started sharing her pregnancy journey with fans via her Insta Stories. We saw several pictures and videos of the singer discussing how hard it is to carry another human being in your tummy; she particularly emphasized the changes it makes to the body.</p><p>In June 2018, Hilary shared a video of her baby’s sex reveal; she did this on Mother’s Day, which saw family and close friends pulling some cannons that shattered in a sea of confetti and pink smoke.</p><p>The expectant mama also teased fans with the first letter of her baby’s name. Referring to her bundle of joy as Baby B, said the “B” serves as a clue and not a reference to the initials of her daughter’s surname, Bair.</p><p>Without revealing the baby’s full name, Hilary hinted that her moniker won’t be too weird but would be quite unique. When baby Banks Violet Bair eventually announced her entrance on the 25th of October, the celebrity couple wasted no time in announcing her arrival through Instagram. We saw a portrait of the female singer holding her beside Koma as she described the experience as absolute magic.</p><p>Koma also took to his Insta Stories to announce the good news. Describing their baby girl as beautiful, a little daughter, and a best friend, the music producer expressed gratitude for his growing family and his then-baby mama, who made everything possible.</p><p>We later saw a sweet selfie of baby Banks asleep on her daddy’s chest through <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Koma’s Instagram</a>.</p><h2><strong>Are Banks Violet Bair’s Parents Still Together?</strong></h2><p>When they gave birth to their first child, Banks Violet Bair, in 2018, the music duo was in a serious relationship. However, the birth of Banks further cemented their love, and on the 21st of December 2019, they took the proverbial walk down the aisle.</p><p>The couple’s nuptials was held in front of their LA home with little Banks, who was barely one acting as the flower girl. Hilary’s daughter was initially scared during the ceremony but calmed down on sighting her father and big brother.</p><p>Before their wedding, the celebrity couple dated for a couple of years. They started going steady during the early part of 2017, and when Koma popped the big question, Hilary was quick to announce it on Instagram. In a post captioned, “He asked me to be his wife,” the mother of three put her ringed finger on display while standing with her love interest.</p><p>Koma reciprocated by sharing the same image on his handle, saying, “I asked my best friend to marry me … @hilaryduff.”</p><h2><strong>Does Banks Violet Bair Have Siblings?</strong></h2><p>Banks Violet Bair is not the only child of her parents. Before Hilary Duff started dating Matthew Koma, she was married to Mike Comrie, and their union birthed a son named Luca Cruz.</p><p>Barely three years after her birth, Banks became a big sister to Matt and Hilary’s second daughter, Mae James, who came to complete their love in March 2021.</p><p>Even though all of Hilary’s children are not from the same father, they share a great bond. Luca once bragged about Bank’s swaddling skills to his friends when she was a baby</p><h2><strong>Hilary Duff’s Daughter Appears to be Taking Music Seriously</strong></h2><p>With a former teenage pop singer for a mum and a Grammy-Award-winning songwriter and music producer for a dad, it came as no surprise that Banks Violet Bair is already taking music seriously as the youngster has been severally spotted belting out tunes.</p><p>There was an adorable video of Banks strapped into her car seat, crooning along to Dolly Parton‘s “Jolene” while eating Cheetos. Hilary, who shared the video, captioned it, “This makes me supremely proud,” while Matt went to the comment section to say, “Oh my God,” confirming that his little daughter was already a fan of Dolly Paton.</p><p>After she turned four, Bank’s dad shared a video in which she was spotted at a Harry Styles concert singing intently. Sitting very close to her mum, the little girl sang the track, Watermelon Sugar word for word. Matt sent a hart warming shout-out on Bank’s fourth birthday, saying, “you always sing with the most engaged and concerned look on your face.”</p><p>Banks started making her own music as a one-year-old. In September 2019, we saw a video where she sat beside her proud papa, playing on her mini pink piano.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZK%2BiusqsZK%2Bhn6GytXnBmqCrZZmoeqm1y5qpsmWUqrOnv4ydmK6fmKmys3nWoquhZZ2WwbW0xLBkpKedlnquscStZKGdomQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./digital-brands-to-downtown-los-angles-row-project-for-holiday-pop-ups-10514319.html>&#171;&nbsp;Row DTLA Taps Digital Brands for Holiday Pop-ups</a>
