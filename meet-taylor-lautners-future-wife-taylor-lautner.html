Dome, who prefers to go by the nickname “Tay,” was born on March 17, 1997, in Los Angeles, California, and grew up in Malibu. She is a healthcare worker and was studying to be a nurse when she and Lautner first got into a relationship.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TAY (@taydome)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>In 2019, she became a registered nurse after completing her studies at the College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita. She thanked Lautner in a heartfelt <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a> for being her source of encouragement even when she felt like giving up when getting through the nursing program became too difficult and tedious. Apparently, someone fits Merriam Webster’s definition of the best boyfriend ever!</p><p>“Thank you for encouraging me when I felt like quitting. Thank you for all the meals you’d make me when I was too busy studying. Thank you for quizzing me and trying to pronounce medical terms and abbreviations.

You mean the world to me & I wouldn’t be where I am today without you.”</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Dome has been working professionally as a nurse ever since, as in May 2021, she celebrated Nurses Week on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> with a few snaps of herself hard at work. She also gave a shoutout to others who have made the decision to devote their lives to the profession of healthcare, “Thank you for all you have given, your drive to keep going, and your heart of gold,” she wrote.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TAY (@taydome)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Apart from working as a nurse, Dome also runs a website <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LEMONS by Tay</a>, which advocates why one should put self-care and mental health first as well as sells products that assist in caring for the same.

But fate had other plans for the Twilight star as it intervened in the form of his sister, Makena Moore, who called up in January that year to tell her brother how she had found his soulmate.&nbsp;</p><p>“She called me and said, ‘Dude, I found your future wife.
